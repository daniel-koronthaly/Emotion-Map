      <h2>Emotion Classification</h2>
      <p>
        Emotion classification is a difficult subject: different people perceive emotions differently, and cultural factors affect emotion expression and valuation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple model for categorizing emotions is the valence-arousal model of emotions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Valence:</strong> Whether an emotion is positive or negative. Indicates pleasantness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Arousal:</strong> The intensity of an emotion, from calm to excited.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
