# Emotion Map

## About

This website was created by **Daniel Koronthály**. During my research in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, I occasionally encountered studies using the valence-arousal model for emotions.

I was never fully convinced of its usefulness, so I created this website for several reasons:

1. To explore whether people's categorizations of different emotions using this model agree or disagree.
2. To gain hands-on experience with technologies I hadn’t used before.
3. To construct a dataset that you can download yourself from the website.

## Usage

1. Open the website and navigate through the informational pages.
2. Submit your demographic information first.
3. Categorize emotions using the valence-arousal model.
4. Download the dataset once you complete the survey if you want to explore the data yourself.

This project is primarily for personal learning and research purposes.
